PPUSTATUS ($2002)

Description: PPU status register
Access:      Read

This register reflects the state of various functions inside the PPU. It is often used for determining timing. To determine when the PPU has reached a given pixel of the screen, put an opaque pixel of sprite 0 there.

7  bit  0

VSO. ....
|||| ||||
|||+-++++- Least significant bits previously written into a PPU register
|||        (due to register not being updated for this address)
||+------- Sprite overflow. The intent was for this flag to be set
||         whenever more than eight sprites appear on a scanline, but a
||         hardware bug causes the actual behavior to be more complicated
||         and generate false positives as well as false negatives; see
||         PPU sprite evaluation. This flag is set during sprite
||         evaluation and cleared at dot 1 (the second dot) of the
||         pre-render line.
|+-------- Sprite 0 Hit.  Set when a nonzero pixel of sprite 0 overlaps
|          a nonzero background pixel; cleared at dot 1 of the pre-render
|          line.  Used for raster timing.
+--------- Vertical blank has started (0: not in vblank; 1: in vblank).
           Set at dot 1 of line 241 (the line *after* the post-render
           line); cleared after reading $2002 and at dot 1 of the
           pre-render line.
